# Hello, I'm Anthony! :wave:

I'm a computer science student based in Seattle.

I enjoy building projects that are innovative and change the lives of others. My
hobbies include, but not limited to, hiking, traveling, jogging, and playing
video games.

While studying at [Seattle University](http://seattleu.edu), here are a few
technologies I've worked with recently:

- JavaScript (ES5)
- React
- Vue
- HTML & (S)CSS
- Python
- C#
- Rust
- Julia
